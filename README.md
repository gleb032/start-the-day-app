# Start the day app
App to start your day with the weather and a quote for the day ahead :)
There is an opportunity to find a city and see the weather there (temperature, feels like temperature and aт image that characterizes the weather - sunny, cloudy, rainy, and so on)

**Stack:** UIKit, Foundation, MVC, URLSession, CoreLocation, UIAlertController, CocoaPods, SwiftLint, UI programally with constraints.

**In Plans:** Rewrite to MVVM, refactor code (swift 5.7)
